## This is an R file that contains two functions
## needed to complete the programming assignment
## for the Coursera course "R Programming"
## For this assignment we need to cache the inverse
## of a matrix

## "Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation 
## and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse 
## of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## The assignment is to write a pair of functions that 
## cache the inverse of a matrix"


## the function makeCacheMatrix() creates a special 
## "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## the function cacheSolve computes the inverse of 
## the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
